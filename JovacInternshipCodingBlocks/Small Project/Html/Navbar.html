        <p id="1"><strong>Ans1.</strong> refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming paradigm that is defined
            using objects.
            Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that have some characteristics and
            behaviors.</p><br>
        <p id="2"><strong>Ans2</strong>There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them
            are:
            OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they donâ€™t know the actual implementation.
            With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
            Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.</p><br>
        <p id="3"><strong>Ans3</strong>
            OOPs or Object Oriented Programming mainly comprises of the below four features, and make sure you don't
            miss any of these:
         
          <pre style="font-size: 25px;">
            1.Inheritance
            2.Encapsulation
            3.Polymorphism
            4.Data Abstraction</pre>
            
          <br>
        </p>
        <p id="4"><strong>Ans 4</strong> oops is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
               Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.</li>
               OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
               OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction. 
               OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach.</li>
               Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs</p><br>
                <p id="5" ><strong>Ans 5</strong>
                    An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviors defined in the class template. In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the blueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behavior.
For example, a specific car.
